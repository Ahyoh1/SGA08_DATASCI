<h1> Loan Prediction </h1>

<p> In finance, a loan is the lending of money by one or more individuals, organizations, or other entities to other individuals, organizations, etc. The recipient (i.e. the borrower) incurs a debt, and is usually liable to pay interest on that debt until it is repaid, and also to repay the principal amount borrowed. 
The whole process of ascertaining if aperson will be offered loan or not might be tedious hence the need to automate the procedure using selected machine learning models. </p>

<h2> Aim and Objective </h2> 

<p> The aim of this project is to determine if a person will be granted loan or not. </p>
<p> An explorative, descriptive and predictive analysis is carried out on the dataset and each observations were 
recorded and meaningful insights were gain from them. </p>

<h2> Results and Accuracy </h2>

<p> The best performing models after hyperparameter tuning were Logistic regression, Random forest and Support vector classifier. A <strong> RMSE </strong > value of 
<strong> 0.44 </strong> was recorded and an <strong> ACCURACY SCORE</strong> of about 80% was achieved.
Further test can be carried out on same dataset 
to improve on the accuracy </p>
